##  Business Overview:
Credit Risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a
loan or meet a contractual obligation. The primary goal of a credit risk assessment is to
find out whether potential borrowers are creditworthy and have the means to repay their
debts so that credit risk or loss can be minimized and the loan is granted to only
creditworthy applicants.
If the borrower shows an acceptable level of default risk, then their loan application can
be approved upon agreed terms.
This project involves understanding financial terminologies attached to credit risk and
building a classification model for default prediction with LightGBM. Hyperparameter
Optimization is done using the Hyperopt library and SHAP is used for model
explainability.

__Aim__
To predict loan defaulters and minimize the risk of loss on the basis of credit history,
employment, and demographic data.

__Data Description__
The dataset contains information about 143727 borrowersâ€™ on various attributes such as
employment type, work experience, income, dependents, total loans, total payment
done, etc.
